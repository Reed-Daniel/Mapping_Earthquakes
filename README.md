# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to use earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API to create an interactive map that visualizes the differences in magnitude of earthquakes all over the world and their relation to tectonic plate location on the earth.

## Resources
- Data Source: [Earthquakes GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), [Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson), [Tectonic Plate GeoJSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)
- Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Leaflet, D3.js 

## Results
